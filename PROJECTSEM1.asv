%estimated frequency = 7555.56 - 444.44 = 7111.12 = 124.112rad/s (discrete fourier signal so f = distance between 2 peaks)

%COMMENT - massive difference of 84.6336Rad/s (124.112 - 39.4784) or
%4849.15Hz when comparing foeqn with fo found in plot 2
%unsure as to why this is the case tbh something to do with fourier

%% Question 3

%Over the range of sample indices 19500 < n â‰¤ 21548,
%speaker 2 is relatively quiet. From the time domain signals x1[n] and x2[n], try to estimate the relative delay between
%these two signals.

%set x1 and x2 to all sample constraints in Q3
x1fsamplesQ3 = x1(19500:21548);
x2fsamplesQ3 = x2(19500:21548);

%setting time to constraint parameters to accomodate for samples in in Q3
%so with parameters you are dealing with x1 and x2 as a whole so set yur
%time parameter to 0.000125 * 35999(number of x1 and samples)
%time delay for full of x1 and x2  = 4.499875
tQ3 = (0:Ts:0.256);
